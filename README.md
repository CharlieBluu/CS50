## This is CS50

This repository will have all of the stuff I make related to CS50. I am taking the course online for free for now.
I will use this space to work on problem sets, and maybe off shoots of code I think up while learning the basics.

Please be aware I am trying to do everything without <cs50.h>, so I will look up alternate ways of solving a couple 
of the initial hiccups.

If you take a peek, Hi!
